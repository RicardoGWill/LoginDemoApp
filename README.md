# LoginDemoApp
This app works witih Google Firebase.  Firebase adds a database aspect so that people can log into the app and the information is stored in an online database.  A user can log in and be taken to "SecondActivity".  But first-time users will have to register.  The registration consists of name, email address, and a password.  Once correctly entered, the information is sent to the Firebase database and the user is sent to the Main Activity's login screen.  Back at the "SecondActivity" after logging in, the user can go to the Profile (or "Refresh" or "Logout).  The profile shows the entered information and the image that was uploaded when registering.  There is an "Update" button that allows the user to update profile information in the app.  However, it does not change login credentials.  However, there is also a "Change Password" button that then takes the user to a page that DOES change the password login credential and updates it on Firebase.  Back to the Profile, images are stored in the "Storage" section of Firebase, and again, using the "Update" function, they can be changed.
